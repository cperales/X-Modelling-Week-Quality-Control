# X Modelling Week: Quality control of optical lenses

This MATLAB codes have been written in order to use them to solve [Problem 3](http://www.mat.ucm.es/congresos/mweek/X_Modelling_Week/Problems.htm) of [X Modelling Week](http://www.mat.ucm.es/congresos/mweek/X_Modelling_Week/index.htm) 2016 in the UCM, about quality control in optical lenses.

Ful report about what has been done can be read [here](http://www.mat.ucm.es/congresos/mweek/X_Modelling_Week/Informes/Report_P3.pdf)

## Notes
It would be interesting to translate MATLAB code into another language. For example, the Python code for average shortest distance can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/cperales/969e91dbab3b1f6ee60370c0ea6fd3a4)
